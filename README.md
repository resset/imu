ChibiOS/RT-based IMU test platform

### About
Code works with ChibiOS/RT version 2.7.0unstable and around.

Successful compilation relies on making symlinks to a few folders (you have to create them inside the main directory):

    boards -> ../chibios/boards/
    ext -> ../chibios/ext/
    os -> ../chibios/os/
    test -> ../chibios/test/

*../chibios* is a path to your ChibiOS/RT directory.
